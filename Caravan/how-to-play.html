        <h2>Building a deck</h2>
        <article>
          Caravan decks consist of at least 30 cards from one of more traditional playing card sets.
          The deck may have any number of cards of any type that suits a player's strategy, although
          it cannot have duplicate cards from the same set. For example a K♠ from set A and a K♠ from
          the set B deck is acceptable, but more than one K♠ from set A would be illegal.

        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <article>
          Caravan is played with two players building three opposing piles (or "caravans") of numbered
          cards. The goal is to outbid your opponent's caravan with the highest value of numbered
          cards without being too light (under 21) or overburdened (over 26).
          <br><br>
          The game begins with each player taking eight cards from their deck and placing either one
          numerical card or ace on each caravan. Players may not discard during this initial round.
          <br><br>
          One both players have started their three caravans, each player may do one of the following
          on their turn:
          <br>
          <span>1.</span> Play one card and draw a new card from his or her deck to their hand,
          <br>
          <span>2.</span> Discard one card from their hand and draw a new card from his or her deck or
          <br>
          <span>3.</span> Discard one of their caravans by removing all cards from that pile.
          <br>
          <br>
          Caravans have a direction, either ascending or descending numerically, and a suit. The suit
          is determined with the first card placed on a caravan, the direction by the second. All
          subsequent cards must continue the numerical direction or match the suit of the previous
          card. Cards of the same numerical value cannot be played in sequence, regardless of suit.
          Face cards can be attached to numeric cards in any caravan and will affect them in various
          ways.

        <h2>Card values</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><span><i>Joker</i></span>
            — Played against Ace, 2-10. Effects change based on whether it is an ace
            or numbered card (see below). Multiple jokers may be played on the same card.
          </li>
          <li><span><i>Ace</i></span>
            — Value of 1. Jokers played on aces remove all other non-face cards of the ace's
            <span>suit</span> from the table. E.g. a joker played on an A♠ removes all spades (except face cards and
            that card, specifically) from the table.
          </li>
          <li><span><i>2-10</i></span>
            — Listed value. Jokers played on these remove all other cards of this value from the
            table. E.g. a joker player on a 4♥ removes all 4s (other than that card, specifically)
            from the table.
          </li>
          <li><span><i>Jack</i></span>
            — Played against Ace, 2-10. Removes that card, along with any face cards
            attached to it.</li>
          <li><span><i>Queen</i></span>
            — Player against Ace, 2-10. Reverses the current direction of the hand, changes
            the current suit of the hand. Multiple queens may be played on the same card.
          </li>
        </ul>
