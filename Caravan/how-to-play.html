        <h2>Building a deck</h2>
        <article>
          Caravan decks consist of at least 30 cards from one of more traditional playing card sets.
          The deck may have <span>any number</span> of cards of any type that suits a player's
          strategy, although it <span>cannot have duplicate cards from the same set</span>. For
          example a K♠ from set A and a K♠ from the set B deck is acceptable, but more than one K♠
          from set A would be illegal.
        </article>

        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <article>
          Caravan is played with two players building three opposing piles (or "caravans") of
          numbered cards. The goal is to outbid your opponent's caravan with the highest value of
          numbered cards without being too light (under 21) or overburdened (over 26).
          <br><br>
          The game begins with each player taking eight cards from their deck and placing either one
          numerical card or ace on each caravan. <span>Players may not discard during this initial
            round</span>.
          <br><br>
          One both players have started their three caravans, each player may do one of the
          following on their turn:
          <br>
          <span>1)</span> play one card and draw a new card from his or her deck to their hand,
          <br>
          <span>2)</span> discard one card from their hand and draw a new card from his or her deck or
          <br>
          <span>3)</span> discard one of their caravans by removing all cards from that pile.
          <br>
          <br>
          Caravans have a <span>direction</span>, either <span>ascending</span> or <span>descending
            numerically</span>, and a <span>suit</span>. The <span>suit</span> is <span>determined
            with the first card placed on a caravan</span>, the <span>direction by the second</span>.
          All <span>subsequent cards must continue the numerical direction or match the suit of
            the previous card</span>. Cards of the <span>same numerical value cannot be played in
            sequence</span>, regardless of suit. Face cards can be attached to <span>numeric</span>
          cards in any caravan and will affect them in various ways.
        </article>

        <h2>Card values</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><span><i>Joker</i></span>
            — played against <span>Ace</span>, <span>2-10</span>. Effects change based on whether it is an ace
            or numbered card (see below). Multiple jokers may be played on the same card.
          </li>
          <li><span><i>Ace</i></span>
            — <span>value of 1</span>. Jokers played on aces remove <span>all other non-face</span>
            cards of the ace's <span>suit</span> from the table. E.g. a joker played on an A♠
            removes all spades (except face cards and that card, specifically) from the table.
          </li>
          <li><span><i>2-10</i></span>
            — listed value. Jokers played on these <span>remove all other cards of this value</span>
            from the table. E.g. a joker player on a 4♥ removes all 4s (other than that card,
            specifically) from the table.
          </li>
          <li><span><i>Jack</i></span>
            — played against <span>Ace</span>, <span>2-10</span>. <span>Removes that card</span>,
            along <span>with any face cards attached</span> to it.</li>
          <li><span><i>Queen</i></span>
            — played against <span>Ace</span>, <span>2-10</span>. <span>Reverses the current
              direction</span> of the hand, <span>changes the current suit</span> of the hand.
            <span>Multiple queens may be played on the same card</span>.
          </li>
        </ul>
